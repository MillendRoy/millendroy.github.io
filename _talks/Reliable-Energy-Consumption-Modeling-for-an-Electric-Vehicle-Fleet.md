In this Conference Proceedings talk, I first highlight the challenges in modelling energy consumption and demonstrate the nature of data which is required to understand the energy consumption of electric vehicles under real-world conditions. Then, I discuss our approach and show how it outperforms Deep Learning based modelling for EV energy consumption prediction.
