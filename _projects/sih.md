Winner of the __Smart India Hackathon__, track set by Mathworks. Later on, the work got accepted in IEEE IEMRE'21.

Renewable Energy and Demand Forecasting in integrated smart grid. 
- Designed an integrated microgrid model in Simulink. 
- Load consumption and energy generation were predicted using ensemble learning algorithms and LSTM cells of Recurrent neural networks (RNN) with R2 values of 0.95 for solar, 0.82 for wind, 0.91 for load and 0.95 for price.
- Linear-Programming based optimization was used for the scheduling of  the sources to meet the load demand, minimizing the cost of distribution and storage of power.
