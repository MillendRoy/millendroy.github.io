This is a part of my Bachelor's Thesis:
- An inbuilt IEEE 34 node bus system is procured where renewable energy sources (PV, Wind and battery) are added at the distribution end in Simulink. 
- Focus is made to work on deep reinforcement learning (A3C) classification framework to identify whether islanding has occurred or not.
