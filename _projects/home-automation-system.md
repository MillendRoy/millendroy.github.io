Here, the objective was to control the lighting system using a smartphone application. 
- 8051 Microcontroller acts as the controller unit of the project where Kiel u Vision 5 provided its coding interface. 
- HC05 bluetooth module establishes the communication channel between phone and controller.
- Comparator IC LM324  converts the analog form of the signal to digital form required by the microcontroller
- Motor driver IC L293d is the small current amplifier which takes in low current control signals from the microcontroller and  converts it to higher current signal for the lighting system.
