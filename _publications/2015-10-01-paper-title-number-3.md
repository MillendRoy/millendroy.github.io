excerpt: 'In this paper, firstly, we highlight the challenges in modelling energy consumption and demonstrate the nature of data which is required to understand the energy consumption of electric vehicles under real-world conditions. Then, through a large and diverse dataset collected over 23,500 hours spanning ≈ 460,000 km with 27 vehicles, we demonstrate our two-stage approach to predict the energy consumption of an EV before the start of the trip. In our energy consumption modelling approach, apart from the primary features recorded directly before the trip, we also construct and predict secondary features through an extensive feature engineering process, both of which are then used to predict the energy consumption.'
