Data Science Intern
- Build a Recommendation Engine ([Hurr.AI](https://hurreytech.com/)) using Reinforcement Learning (AI Ed and NLTK) to surface the right learning material to the right student at the right time and in the right channel.
- The engine can address to different classrooms. Even peer to peer chats can be benefitted through this utility.

Since, a stealth startup not much can be disclosed, please visit here for the [internship completion letter](../files/1597074420921.pdf) from the Hurrey Tech Ventures Founder.
